That's a project using [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [openCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) to a contourn into imagens, or make them into a polaroid effect. The new images will be in a folder name directory from original images.

Code exemple:

`python .\imageFrame\ -fp "c:\Users\UserName\Pictures" -fr 0.1 -pm 5`
